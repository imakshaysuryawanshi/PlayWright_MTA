/*Question 4 — Build Health Reporter
Problem: Given the percentage of test cases passed in a CI build, 
report build health.
100% → Green Build
90–99% → Stable (investigate failures)
70–89% → Unstable
Below 70% → Broken Build (block deployment)*/

let buildHealth = "75%";
if (buildHealth === '100%') {
    console.log("Green Build");
} else if (buildHealth >= '90%' && buildHealth <= '99%') {
    console.log("Stable (investigate failures)");
} else if (buildHealth >= '70%' && buildHealth <= '89%') {
    console.log("Unstable");
} else {
    console.log("Broken Build (block deployment)");
}
